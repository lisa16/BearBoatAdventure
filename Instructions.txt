********** INSTRUCTIONS **********

Welcome to the Bear Boat Adventure Game!

Get ready to drive the boat with your bear buddy Ben, and you are going to race with his friends


Press the START button to start your journey

Every time you make a blow, you are diving your little bear boat further forward!
But be careful... if you blow too weak, you will lose some power and be lagging behind :(
                  however, when you make it way too strong, the little bear cannot control the boat either
Try some good breaths!
There will be a PROGRESSING BAR beside your boat telling you whether you did a good breath

You get a STAR :), every time you made a good breath
Five good breath in a row, you will be awarded a 'DIAMOND'!

After every 15 TIMES of breaths, there comes the HUFF and COUGH TIME~ Dragon Druff will be along with you~
When break time is over, press READY... to continue your journey

Your task is to walking through all the SIX ADVENTURE with Bear Ben. Guess how many diamonds you can get


Time to start up! Your little bear is waiting on you...
